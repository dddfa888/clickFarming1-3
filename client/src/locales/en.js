    "Company Profile": "Mercado Libre was founded by Marcos Galperín. In March 1999, while pursuing an MBA at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business in the United States, he conceived the concept of this platform. After completing university, he received funding from YPF to carry out the research project while working in the company's finance department. However, during his studies, Repsol acquired YPF, and the department where Galperín was working was shut down. It was at this point that Galperín began a three-month research and consulting period, analyzing with other professors the possibility of establishing an online marketplace in Latin America. His finance professor, Jack McDonald, helped him secure his first investor, John Muse. After earning his bachelor's degree, he spent some time founding the company and launched it publicly on August 2, 1999, quickly expanding into Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Despite the challenges, Mercado Libre underwent two funding rounds. Galperín stated, “There was no local venture capital, and international firms were unwilling to bet on Latin America.” The first round occurred in November 1999 and the second in May 2000. Investors included JP Morgan Partners, Flatiron Fund, Hicks, John Muse, Tate & Furst, Goldman Sachs, Fondo CRI, Banco Santander Central Hispano, and GE Equity. According to Galperín in *Time* magazine: “We had to build everything from scratch. E‑commerce logistics and digital payment infrastructure—we had to create it ourselves. Some of our international competitors, like eBay and Amazon, started from scratch too. Interestingly, after our 21st anniversary, we began growing even faster. We are democratizing Latin America’s finance and commerce. It’s a success story that took over twenty years to become an overnight sensation.",
